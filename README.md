# About the Project

This repository was created to organize the code and materials I use for daily study and development. I've always enjoyed self-study, but one thing I've noticed over my more than ten years of experience is how easy it is to forget our progress and where we've been, especially with the overwhelming amount of information available today. Due to a lack of organization, I've lost a lot of cool things I've developed.

Initially, this repository was going to be private, but since I plan to add various study resources and interesting projects for other developers, I've decided to make it public, hoping it can be useful to others.

## Organization

The files are organized into folders named `Day[N] + Project Title`, e.g., `day1-scoreboard`. The "Day" in the folder names does not represent actual consecutive days but rather a way to organize the folders in ascending order and a personal way to demonstrate progress throughout my studies.

Each "Day" represents a project, a starting point for executing an idea, which may take a day, a week, or even a year to complete. Therefore, occasionally, within these folders, there will be a subfolder called `_studies`, which represents the "draft" of the project, containing all the materials I developed or executed to complete the main project, akin to the preparation stages for executing the main idea.

Since the primary goal here is to document my studies and projects, each main folder contains a `README.md` file with an explanation of the project and its technologies, documentation when necessary, a link to the project running in production, and a list of articles, courses, and tutorials used during the project with their respective repositories in the `_studies` folder, when applicable.

When a project is in progress, a `_[IN PROGRESS]_ ` tag will be added to the top of the `README.md` file to indicate that the project is not yet completed.

## About Me

If you want to know more about me and my studies, I intend to share my journey so far in the [day0-hello-world/README.md](./day0-hello-world/README.md) file.
