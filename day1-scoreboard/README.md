Like I said in The Day 0, I decided to start studying like I not knew anything, 
from scratch, for that I decide to take a course about JavaScript really for beginners. This is the first DIY from the course.

This project is part of the course Learn JavaScript available on [Scrimba](https://v2.scrimba.com/) And the idea was creating a scoreboard that get increased when click in the buttons. A really simple way to learn about JS Events and basic functions.

In my point of view that project was interesting because they provided to us only a figma file with the specs and, we were encouraged to build from scratch.

Form me that already have a bit of experience, this was not really charllenge and I use a lot of thing that was not viewed in that step of the course, and they encourage that kind of attitude.  

So for exemple in the original project, the Idea was mixing HTML and JS, something that is note profitable in a real project, but is very acepptable to introduce someone to the basics concepts. But in my version of the project I decided to apply the good pratices.  

Other point, is that in class, they don't use ```dataset``` to dynamic pass the score to JS and all the buttons haved their ow functions, again, to introduce the basis, this is ok, but, prefered do something more cleaner, then I change these parts. 

Other important point, is that, like this project is only for the purpose to learn Javascript, these page are not responsible. The course even talk about this topic yet. And how me focus is on JS and in the future Backend, I don't see any reason to add the feature even thought I know how. 

In general, for someone that are really in Day 1 I think this is very helpful to build skills.

I pass the last 12 year build or working with some really scare and ugly things, projects
in real world that take off you sleep. So, return to the bases and build something really 
simple like this, made me get some happy for today! 

This is was a great Day 1!
