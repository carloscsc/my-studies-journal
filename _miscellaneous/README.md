**Note:** This repository is part of a personal project called [my-studies-journal](https://github.com/carloscsc/my-studies-journal). The goal is to organize the code, study materials, and personal projects I use daily. For more details, please visit the main page of the repository.

In my day-to-day activities, I consume many articles or tutorials that are not necessarily related to any specific project. Therefore, I created this folder where I will store this material in a somewhat unordered manner, just as a way to archive them.
