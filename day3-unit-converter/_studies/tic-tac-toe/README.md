# Tic-Tac-Toe

[[see in action]](https://my-study-journal.vercel.app/day3-unit-converter/_studies/tic-tac-toe/dist)

Project based on the tutorial: [React.dev/Learn/Tutorial: Tic-Tac-Toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)

## P.S.

I add the `dist` folder in the main branch, only to deploy it to Vercel
in the most easiest way. In a real scenario, Is better to use a dedicated repo and
a separated branch for the production code.
